Theme of this symposium is "Next generation technologies and wave of globalization'' . 
This symposium will be a great opportunity for enthusiastic students to meet peers from other institutions and socialize with them, 
present their project work, expose their talents in both technical as well as cultural aspects and improve communication skills. Overall, 
it is a great opportunity for students to get good exposure rather than being glued to their books all the time..
